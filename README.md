<h3>Approach Taken</h3>
<p>
I began with several user stories for this type of application:
* As someone living in Seattle's Greenlake neighborhood, I want to find a local karaoke venue thatâ€™s near me.
* As a karaoke newbie, I want to find out about the most popular places to Karaoke. 
* As an experienced singer, I want to know where to karaoke every night of the week.
* As an avid karaoker, I want to keep track of the places I have karaoke'd in the past.

Working from these stories, I utilized Balsamiq to create wireframes for the Home, Venue and Song pages: https://github.com/bethburger42/karaoke-dokie/tree/master/static/images/wireframes.png

After reviewing these mockups with a UX designer and revisiting the user stories, I discarded the Songs page and focused on the main draws to the website: finding nearby karaoke venues and karaoke nights.

Order of development:
* Database: Created a postgres database with User and Provider tables.
* Website framework: All pages were built using the Bootstrap framework to allow responsiveness on multiple devices.
* Venues page: Yelp list: Set up Yelp API tokens and verified the ability to pull data from the Yelp API. Set up a "venues" controller to route data from the Yelp API to the Venues page.
* Local login: Created a login page and wrote a "strategies" config file for logging into the site and saving sessions
* Facebook login: Created a Facebook app. Added functionality to the "strategies" config file and the login page to allow logging in and out of the app with Facebook.
* Calendar page: Search results: Created a test page for scraping data from TheStranger.com website. Wrote a "calendar" controller to route data from this website to deisplay on the Calendar page.
* Venues page: Map: Placed a map on the Venues page and wrote a JavaScript file for integrating map data from Google Maps.
* Home page: Designed a carousel to house text and images directing users to the app pages.
* Calendar page: Calendar: Designed a calendar using the JQuery UI Datepicker. This utility is the basis for the results from The Stranger website displayed in a list on the page. 
* Calendar page: Featured venue: Included an image link with floating text to direct users to a featured karaoke venue.
* Home page: Embedded a karaoke YouTube video and a karaoke songbook website image and link.
